# Chip-8 emulator
Chip-8 emulator with own assembler and disassembler. GUI for this emulator is implemented with [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib). Raylib version 4.0.0 should work.

## Building project
### Dependecies
At the moment of writing, raylib which is used in for GUI implementation is unavailable from (official) Ubuntu package repositories. See guides in [raylib wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki) to install it on your system.

### Compiling
Run ```make``` to compile this project.

## Usage
Compiling a chip-8 program and running the binaries:
```
./assembler chip8_res/button-test.asm button-test.ch8
./emulator button-test.ch8 
```

Disassembling a chip-8 binary:
```
./assembler button-test.ch8 button-test.asm.2 -d
```

### Emulator key bindings
```ESC``` will quit the emulator.

Input keys:
```
1-2-3-4
q-w-e-r
a-s-d-f
z-x-c-v
```
